# Microsoft-Movie-Analysis

**Author**: [Stacy Kiriiri](mailto:wkiriiri@gmail.com)

## Overview

This is a data analysis project conducted for Microsoft's new movie studio. The goal of this project is to analyze movie data
to provide actionable insights for Microsoft to decide what type of films to create.

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they do not know anything about creating movies. I was charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. I had to translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio
can use to make informed decisions about movie production.

## Data             

In the folder zippedData are movie datasets from:

[Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/),
[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/),
[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/),
[TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/),
[The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

These are the datasets used for analysis.

## Methods

This project uses exploratory data analysis to generate insights for the business stakeholder.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the analysis, you will need Jupyter Notebook, Python, and the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

To start the analysis, open [Jupyter Notebook](./student.ipynb) 

## Results

The analysis yielded three concrete business recommendations for Microsoft:

## Conclusions

This project provides valuable insights from exploratory data analysis to guide Microsoft's new movie studio in making informed 
decisions about movie production. This is done by understanding the trends in movie genres, box office performance, and audience sentiments.Microsoft can create successful and profitable movies in the competitive entertainment industry.
