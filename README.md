# Microsoft-Movie-Analysis

**Author**: [Stacy Kiriiri](mailto:wkiriiri@gmail.com)

## Overview

This is a data analysis project based on an assumption that Microsoft Company wants to venture into movie production
hence they need some insights on what type of films to create.

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they do not know anything about creating movies. I was charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. I had to translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

## Data

In the folder zippedData are movie datasets from:

[Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
[Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
[TheMovieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
[The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)

This are the datasets used for analysis.
